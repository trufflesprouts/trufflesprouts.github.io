title:  "Kicking Off My New Site And Blog"
---

In 2013, I began a blog called [Fledgling Physicist]. Its goal was to document my thoughts and things I learned while studying physics at the University of Pennsylvania. Several of my posts received considerable attention, including "If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You" and a short series I wrote on Axions.

My life has changed quite a bit since that blog began. I am now a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) at Uber, I'm finishing up a book on microservice architecture and standardization, and my areas of interest and research have expanded to include (along with physics and philosophy) computer science, software engineering, and myrmecology. Fledgling Physicist doesn't accurately capture my current areas of research, so I've decided to start a new website and accompanying blog.

Unlike my previous blog, this new site will contain information about my areas of research and events I will be speaking at. It will also feature a brand-new blog where I'll write about computer science, myrmecology, philosophy, physics, software engineering, and anything else I find interesting or important. I'll be moving any important information and post history to this site, and eventually fledglingphysicist will redirect here.

It's with great excitement that I kick off this new site. I have many grand ideas and plans in store, and I can't wait to share them with you all!
