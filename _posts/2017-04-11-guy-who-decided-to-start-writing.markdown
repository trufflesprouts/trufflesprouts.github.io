title:  "Guy Who Decided to Start Writing"
---

I never really wanted to start a blog - maybe a little - but after writing all my university application essays I missed writing. I'm in no way a good writer, I rarely wrote in English before, besides random internet comments, and most times I just copy someone else's and modify it a bit. So, I'm committing myself to writing at least one post a month, and hopefully, improve my writing and understanding of the subject matter at the same time.

Writing is terrifying.

Really it is. In fact, I just copied the previous line from Jordan Scales because I didn't know how to start the next paragraph. But the point still holds, writing on the interwebs is terrifying because you're exposing yourself, what if someone discovers how stupid I am? what if after reading one of my posts someone decides to go look through my Github, and sees my inconsistent semicolon placement? or none existent readme files? or my god-awful variable names? worse yet, once few people read it, it will live forever, everyone will read what I wrote when I was 19. No pressure.

I will write about random things including programming, physics, space (and spaceships), art, stock markets and personal events. Since I intend to write for myself I won't confine my writing to any topic. I will try writing a really long post on one subject this year, It should be a great learning experience.

If you read this post, I will reward you with this bit of cheesy comedy.
