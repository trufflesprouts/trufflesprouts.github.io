### Introduction

Over the past few years, ever since writing "If Susan Can Learn Physics, So Can You", I've been contacted by people from all backgrounds who are inspired and want to learn physics, but don't know where to start, what to learn, what to read, and how to structure their studies. I've spoken with single mothers who want to go back to school and study physics, tenured philosophy professors who want to learn physics so that they can make significant and informed contributions to philosophy of physics, high school students who want to know what they should read to prepare for an undergraduate education in physics, and people in dozens of various careers who want to really, really learn and understand physics simply for the joy of it.

This post is a condensed version of what I've sent to people who have contacted me over the years, outlining what everyone needs to learn in order to really understand physics.

The general physics education given in U.S. universities is divided into what is learned at the undergraduate level and what is covered in graduate courses, and I've divided my list in a similar way. Because each subject is built upon the previous subjects and the mathematics becomes more complex and difficult, it's important to learn each topic in the order presented below.

If you work through the all of the textbooks in the Undergraduate Physics list of this post, and master each of the topics, you'll have gained the knowledge equivalent of a Bachelor's Degree in Physics (and will be able to score well on the Physics GRE).  If you work through the graduate core of the Graduate Physics textbooks, you'll have the equivalent knowledge of obtaining a Master's Degree in Physics. A PhD in Physics requires the graduate coursework as well as several years of research and a thesis, and the experience involved in a PhD isn't something that can be gained independently of a PhD program.

Remember that anyone can learn physics. It's no different from learning programming, from learning a musical instrument, from reading great literature. Whether you turn it into a hobby or a career, the pure joy of understanding the universe around us is one of the most beautiful experiences you can ever have in life.

Please comment with your experiences and with any suggestions you have for improving this list!

### Before You Begin

Popular Books on Physics (The Good Ones)
When you're solving problems, working through textbooks, getting into the nitty-gritty details of each topic, it's so easy to lose the forest for the trees and forget why you even became inspired to study physics in the first place. This is where really, really good (and non-speculative) books on physics come in handy: they inspire, they encourage, and they help you understand the big picture.

One big problem is that a lot of the popular books written about physics (especially those by famous physicists) are incredibly speculative and tend to present an unrealistic view of what the study of physics is all about. When you're learning physics, it's good to avoid these types of speculative books, and stick to the good ones that talk about the real physics we know exists.

Here are some of my favorite popular physics books:

- The Feynman Lectures on Physics (Boxed Set) and Feynman Lectures on Physics (Kindle Edition): Feynman's Lectures on Physics are essential readings for everyone interested in physics, and you'll find a copy on the bookshelf of every amateur physicist and professional physicist. These lectures are what got me into physics: my astronomy professor told me to read them and see if I liked physics - they changed my life!
- The Character of Physical Law by Richard Feynman: A brilliant, inspiring little book on the laws of nature.
- Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics by Bruce Schumm: the very best popular book about particle physics. I had the honor of working with Bruce Schumm on a search for supersymmetry at the ATLAS detector, and he has one of those brilliant minds that understands physics so deeply that he can explain it to anyone without resorting to speculation.
- The Particle Odyssey by Frank Close: another brilliant popular introduction to particle physics and its history, beautifully illustrated with amazing figures and photographs.
- Weinberg's The First Three Minutes: an account of the Big Bang by one of the most brilliant physicists of all time.
