As many of you probably know, I've led a rather peculiar life. Until I turned 18 and enrolled at Arizona State University, I received no formal education aside from a few music classes at a local community college. I was homeschooled by my mother until I was around 12 or 13, and then, when she had to return to work and enrolled my younger siblings in public school, I began working full-time instead of going to school.

By the time I was in my early teens, I felt, deep in my heart, that it was over for me: I saw what my siblings were learning, I saw what my friends my own age were learning, and I felt hopeless because I knew absolutely none of it, and felt there was no way I could ever catch up. I realized that my life could go one of two ways: I could resign myself to forever working minimum-wage jobs and never receiving any formal education, or I could rebel against that feeling of inferiority and ignorance, educate myself, and somehow make it to college.

I remember very vividly the moment I decided to take the latter path: I was sitting in my father's small office, opening each of his books and trying to figure out what I could learn from them, and I decided that I was going to make something of myself. I stood up, told myself "I am going to be great", and went to my room to formulate a plan.

My plan was simple: learn only the topics that I could approach without the help of a teacher, and give up on ever learning the rest. Math, science, and any technology went out the window - I determined there was no way I could learn those on my own (boy, was I wrong!) - and I focused on foreign languages, literature, history, and philosophy.

After four years of working during the day and reading every night, I took the ACT, scored perfectly on everything except math and science, and was admitted to multiple universities with scholarship offers. Due to family circumstances, I chose to stay at ASU and study philosophy, where I took graduate courses in philosophy for two years and was introduced to physics. I transferred to Penn, where I finally learned the math and physics I never thought I would be capable of learning. And here I am today in San Francisco, getting ready for my book on software architecture to be published, doing the computer science and software engineering I thought was reserved only for those "smart, educated kids".

I'm going to write a blog post someday about how I actually went about homeschooling myself (mostly because it's a fascinating case study of blind and ignorant optimism that somehow converged to the norm), but today I want to share twenty books I read both during that time and during my time at ASU and Penn that shaped and drove this strange path of mine, that brought me to exactly where I am today.

(Note: this list does not present the books in the chronological order of reading, but rather in their order of influence on my mind and life).
