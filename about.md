I am a self-taught programmer and I love making things for the web. I currently work with Lime developing a new publishing platform, I do lots of things including full stack development, testing, and UI/UX design.

On the side, I enjoy working on tough problems, that’s why I’m focusing on machine learning and AI. I hate most dev tools and consider them to be a necessary evil.
